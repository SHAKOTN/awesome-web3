## Blockchains

### Bitcoin

- [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) <br> A father of all blockchains. Bitcoin development on [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin)
- [Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) <br> Writing smart contracts on Bitcoin is possible, however, not that simple
- [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) <br> L2 scaling solution for Bitcoin protocol, aimed to solved scalability problem

### Ethereum

- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) <br> Blockchain and platform to execute smart contracts and to run decentralized web3 applications
- [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) <br> Ethereum native language to write smart contracts
- [Vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper) <br> Ethereum another native language for smart contracts development. Used less frequently than solidity
- [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) <br> Ethereum turing-complete virtual machine, runtime environment to execute smart contracts
- [Ethereum Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/) <br> Ethereum gas price estimator to predict gas consumption for smart contracts execution
- [Polygon](https://github.com/maticnetwork) <br> L2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Most widely used as of 2021
- [Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum) <br> Another L2 scaling solution for Ethereum
